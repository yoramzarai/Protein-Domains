[Output]

format = "expanded"  # Set to "basic": all transcripts and domains are listed in one excel sheet, where each row represents a domain.
                # Set to "compact": all transcripts and domains are listed in one excel sheet, where each row represents a transcript 
                # (all domains are aggregated in one cell, domains are '|' separated, domain's fields are ',' separated.)
                # Set to "expanded":  each transcript (and its domains) are listed in a separate excel sheet

[Debug]
enable = true  # Set to false [true] to disable [enable] debug prints
